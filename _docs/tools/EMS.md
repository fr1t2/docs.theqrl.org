With the latest HardFork The QRL has relesed what we call our Ephemeral Messaging System or EMS. At 5he base of this system is lattice based cryptography which is emplored using our quantum resistan XMSS hash based signitures to sign and submit the generated keys onto the chain. This system allows the useage of a QRL address to geerate a set of kekys that can be used in ephemeral systems.
