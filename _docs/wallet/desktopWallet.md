The QRL wallet can be ran from any modern PC and is the exact same application that is ran in production and hosted at [wallet.theqrl.org](https://wallet.theqrl.org)

It provides both web and desktop interfaces using Meteor, Semantic UI, NodeJS and Electron.

All secure XMSS operations are run in a web assembly compiled version of qrllib locally in your browser or desktop application. Keys stay in the memory space of the XMSS object, which is destroyed the moment you close the wallet, browser window or desktop application.

> The source code can be found at [https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet](https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet) if you would like to contribute.
