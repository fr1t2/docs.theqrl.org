description: Instructions for setting up a mining pool to mine QRL using GPU and advanced hardware. 
tags: mining
---

To fully utilize the benefits of multiple devices or GPU mining rigs, one can setup a stratum pool and use multiple machines to mine as the same device, effectively raising the hashrate of the mining efforts and increasing the odds of finding blocks. 

Running a pool will also increase the redundancy and decentralization of the blockchain. A mining pool is required to run a full QRL node, syncing and verifying transactions on the network by default.

Running a mining pool is not something that should be taken lightly. You need to have a good understanding of multiple complex administration and security practices. This is not something that an amateur should attempt or be run from a home.

 If you need help, reach out to the community in the discord chat or on Reddit.

## Requirements

#### Hardware

* minimum 4GB RAM 
* 2 Core 
* Support for AES-NI 
* HDD large enough to support the blockchain over time ( > 120GB )
* 64 bit Processor 
* high bandwidth network connection
* Dedicated IP address

#### Software and OS

* This guide uses Ubuntu 16.04
* python 3.5 or greater is required
* node 0.10.48
* [node-cryptonote-pool fork](https://github.com/theQRL/node-cryptonote-pool.git)

## QRL Install

Follow the instructions found [docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/](https://docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/) to get the node started.

An abridged version can be found below

```bash
# update
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Dependencies
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.qrlRequirementsUbuntu }}

# Install the qrl Package.
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.qrlInstall }}
```

This will install qrl and create  `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlDir }}
`

### Start QRL and Sync

Before you start the node you need to create a configuration file to give the QRL node instructions on how to run.

Create a `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.confLocation }}` file and add any configuration settings you may need. 

At minimum you must have:

```yml
mining_enabled: False
enable_peer_discovery: True
mining_api_enabled: True
public_api_enabled: True
```

Then you can start the node and begin syncing the blockchain.

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.startQRL }}
```

Check the state of the qrl node with 

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.qrlState }}
```

Verify the local node blockheight matches the [block explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org)

## Pool Install


To install the pool follow the instruction in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/theQRL/node-cryptonote-pool.git)


#### Dependencies

* NodeJS
* nvm
* Node V 0.10.48
* Redis-server
* Node-Cryptonote-Pool Found [Here](https://github.com/theQRL/node-cryptonote-pool.git)
   * This is a fork form the popular *zone117x node-cryptonote-pool*


## grpcProxy


Run the `{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.grpcProxy }}` to bridge the gap between RPC to gRPC. 

This is required since the QRL node uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and runs on port 19000, the pool software runs [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) and is expecting to find the node at port 18090. This needs to run for hte pool to connect to the node and function.


#### Slaves.json File

In order to run the `{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.grpcProxy }}` you will need to generate a `slaves.json` file renamed as `payment_slaves.json`   

Follow the guide found [Here](/wallet/slaves.json) to generate a slaves.json file

This will allow the pool the ability to send the payments out to miners and allows more OTS keys to be used for the wallet. 

Generate a slaves file with 100 slaves, which will take awhile. This will give a factor of 1024\*100 signatures before the need to generate another slaves.json file and set it in the `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlDir }}` directory.

Run the proxy with the following:

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.grpcProxy }}
```

## Install Web Server

You will need a web server setup somewhere pointed at the pool API port. See the README.md in the pool github for instructions on setting up the web front end.



## Secure The Server

Being that this is running a mining pool and handling money, you need to ensure the up most security is used. Follow the latest industry standards for securing Ubuntu.

> Do not use clear text passwords and ensure that ssh is as locked down as possible.
{: .info}

## Start The Pool

With the QRL node fully synced and running, slaves.json file in the correct place, {{ layout.v.qrlConf.confLocation }} file correctly filled out, redis-server running,  and the qrl_grpc_proxy running, you can start the pool.


Enjoy


## Pool Config File

Copy the `config_example.json` file to `config.json` then overview each options and change any to match your preferred setup.
